# INTRODUCTION
In this assignment to tackle the problem of misidentification of characters by the OCR system, we implement a search 
based algorithm which helps us to identify the misplaced characters in the words in a level wise fashion, based on how
much error is present in the word. The words would be replaced based on the cost function, on the basis whether the cost of 
the sentence is getting reduced after replacement.

# CORE IDEAS 
1. Precomputation of conf_matrix_inv - using the given conf_matrix in order to prevent exhaustive repeated search of each
entry of conf_matrix for each character replacement.
2. Local search/Hill climbing search -
3. Breadth first exhaustive search -
4. Breadth first random search -
5. Change backtracking - Some words might be replaced because of the local optimality that we are checking, as well as because
of the initial mistakes present in the complete sentence, so a backtracking of Change is essential to check if the original words
were better for the overall sentence. 

# Algorithm
1. Initially we precompute a inverse configuration matrix, computed using the given conf_matrix which stores all the characters
that can come in place of the misplaced character, assuming that character is misplaced.
2. Then, we begin in a level wise manner, based on the no. of errors a word might have. We first begin
